I am currently a software engineer at Facebook AI.  I was an MSCS student at Stanford, where I worked in the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](http://svl.stanford.edu/), specifically in the [Partnership in AI-Assisted Care](https://aicare.stanford.edu/) led by Professor [Fei-Fei Li](http://vision.stanford.edu/feifeili/) and Professor [Arnold Milstein](https://petersonhealthcare.org/leadership/bio-arnold-milstein).  I also worked with Professor [Giancarlo Pellegrino](https://trouge.net/) 
at the [Stanford Computer Security Laboratory](https://seclab.stanford.edu/). 
I worked with multiple security groups during my undergraduate years at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, including the [Illinois Security Lab](https://seclab.illinois.edu/) with Professor [Carl Gunter](http://cgunter.cs.illinois.edu/)
and the Hatswitch group with Professor [Nikita Borisov](https://hatswitch.org/nikita/).

Research Interests
------
I worked on [defenses against machine learning attacks](/publication/SnP_Sentinet) covering mechanisms including data poisoning and adversarial perturbations, and privacy-safe deep learning using [unintrusive sensors](/publication/NIPS_ML4H_LowRes), [homomorphic encryption](/publication/SnP_Cryptonet), and [differentially-private training](/publication/manuscript_pipeline), especially within healthcare contexts.

I have explored core computer vision problems such as [fewshot learning](/publication/ECCV_Fewshot) and [video retrieval](/publication/ECCV_Temporal) and applying action recognition techniques for [healthcare](/publication/MLHC_ICU) tasks.
