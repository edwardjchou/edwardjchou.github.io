I am a second year MSCS student at Stanford.
I currently work with Professor [Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/) 
and Professor [Giancarlo Pellegrino](https://trouge.net/) 
at the [Stanford Computer Security Laboratory](https://seclab.stanford.edu/). 
I am also part of the [Stanford Vision Lab](http://vision.stanford.edu/), specifically in the [Partnership in AI-Assisted Care](https://aicare.stanford.edu/) led by Profesor [Fei-Fei Li](http://vision.stanford.edu/feifeili/) and Professor [Arnold Milstein](https://petersonhealthcare.org/leadership/bio-arnold-milstein).
I worked with multiple security groups during my undergraduate years at the University of Illinois, including the [Illinois Security Laboratory](https://seclab.illinois.edu/) with Professor [Carl Gunter](http://cgunter.cs.illinois.edu/)
and the Hatswitch group with Professor [Nikita Borisov](https://hatswitch.org/nikita/).

Research Interests
------
My research interests primarily lie within the intersection of security and machine learning.
I currently work on [defenses against machine learning attacks](/publication/SnP_Sentinet) covering mechanisms including data poisoning and adversarial perturbations.
I also focus on privacy-safe deep learning using [unintrusive sensors](/publication/NIPS_ML4H_LowRes), [homomorphic encryption](/publication/SnP_Cryptonet), and [differentially-private training](/publication/manuscript_pipeline).

Previously, I have explored core computer vision problems such as [fewshot learning](/publication/ECCV_Fewshot) and [video retrieval](/publication/ECCV_Temporal) and applying action recognition techniques for [healthcare](/publication/MLHC_ICU) tasks.
Going back even further, I have worked in core computer security and [privacy](/publication/PETS_Fingerprinting) research, especially on [side-channel attacks](/publication/CCS_3DPrinter).
