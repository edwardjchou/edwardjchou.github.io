Abstract
-------
We have successfully demonstrated the remote optical readout of intraocular pressure
(IOP) from nanodot-enhanced micromachined IOP sensors implanted in ex-vivo and in-vivo rabbit
eyes at a distance of 12 cm using the Zeiss SL-30 slit lamp, a standard ophthalmic scope widely
used by clinicians. This detection distance of 12 cm has not been accomplished by other
technical approaches such as inductor- or capacitor-coupling method. We achieved this result by
(1) designing optomechanical IOP sensors with a noticeably high signal-to-noise ratio; and (2)
incorporating a novel robust detection algorithm, which includes a highly precise opto-mechanical
model. This model allows us to remove the background noise and instantaneously map the
sensorâ€™s optical signal to a corresponding IOP value. We believe that this achievement -- a
clinically significant readout distance accomplished using a well established ophthalmic clinical
scope -- makes our IOP system a more clinically viable choice.
