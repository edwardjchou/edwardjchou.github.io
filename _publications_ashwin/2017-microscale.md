Abstract
-------
Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a key clinical parameter in glaucoma management. However, despite the potential utility of daily
measurements of IOP in the context of disease management, the necessary tools are currently lacking, and IOP is typically
measured only a few times a year. Here we report on a microscale implantable sensor that could provide convenient, accurate, ondemand
IOP monitoring in the home environment. When excited by broadband near-infrared (NIR) light from a tungsten bulb, the
sensor’s optical cavity reflects a pressure-dependent resonance signature that can be converted to IOP. NIR light is minimally
absorbed by tissue and is not perceived visually. The sensor’s nanodot-enhanced cavity allows for a 3–5 cm readout distance with
an average accuracy of 0.29 mm Hg over the range of 0–40 mm Hg. Sensors were mounted onto intraocular lenses or silicone
haptics and secured inside the anterior chamber in New Zealand white rabbits. Implanted sensors provided continuous in vivo
tracking of short-term transient IOP elevations and provided continuous measurements of IOP for up to 4.5 months.
