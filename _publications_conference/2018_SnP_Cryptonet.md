Abstract
-------
For use in vibration-driven power generation, we have quantitatively characterized the acousto-mechanical
vibrations that propagate from the human vocal folds through the neck and head along the skeletal frames during speech
production. The acousto-mechanical vibrations can excite vibration-driven energy harvesters at their resonance frequencies
between 90-300 Hz and generate up to 0.15 mW/cm3 on demand, which is sufficient to power a group of medical electronic
implants and eliminate the use of bulky batteries that require periodic replacement.
